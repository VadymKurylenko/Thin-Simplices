# Thin Simplices

This is the supporting code for the paper Thin Simplices via Modular Arithmetic. 

In the file Thin codes.ipynb the function thin_codes(pool,d,N,r) allows one to compute all linear codes over ZZ_N generated by at most r rows corresponding to thin simplices of dimension d. 

Moreover, the function thin_codes_experimental allows one to relatively quickly find examples of thin linear codes. 

In the folder ThinSimplices there is a database of thin simplices of various dimensions.
