# Thin Simplices

This is the supporting code for the paper Thin Simplices via Modular Arithmetic. 

In the file Thin codes.ipynb the function thin_codes(pool,d,N,r) allows one to compute all linear codes over ZZ_N generated by at most r rows corresponding to thin simplices of dimension d. 

Moreover, the function thin_codes_experimental allows one to relatively quickly find examples of thin linear codes. 

In the folder ThinSimplices there is a database of thin simplices of various dimensions. Depending on which function produced the files, they are named ThinSimplicesd_N or experimental_ThinSimplicesd_N, where d is the dimension of the corresponding simplex and N is the N_\Delta.  The first line of each file contains the list of all the generating matrices found. Each of the other lines gives further info  such as h^* and weight enumerator of each entry. 

The function thin_codes uses the multiprocessing package. The file weight_decider.py contains several functions that had to be written in Python and not Sage to be used with multiprocessing.
